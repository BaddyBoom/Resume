FOR OUR WEB TECHNOLOGY PROJECT, WE HAVE CREATED A WEBSITE FOR A NON GOVERNMENT ORGANISATION WHICH GOES BY THE NAME, AASHRAYA FOUNDATION. THIS NGO WORKS IN THE FIELDS OF WOMEN EMPOWERMENT, CHILD WELFARE, SANITARY WORKSHOPS AND MUCH MORE. OUR PROJECT CONSISTS OF 9 PAGES, NAMELY: HOMEPAGE, ABOUT US, ACHIEVEMENTS, DONOR-FORM, SPONSORS, EVENTS, JOIN US, OUT TEAM AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. WE HAVE DESIGNED OUR WEBSITE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE MAKE USE OF ALL THE CONCEPTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO US IN CLASS. WE HAVE INCORPORATED SERVER SIDE (JAVASCRIPT) AS WELL AS CLIENT SIDE (PHP) SO AS TO MAKE OUR WEBSITE A FULLY FUNCTIONING ONE. WE HAVE ALSO SPENT TIME LEARNING NEW CONCETS AND INCLUDING THEM IN THIS PROJECT, SUCH AS CSS TRANSITIONS AND ANIMATIONS, PARALLAX, MYSQL ETC. THIS WEBSITE DOES NOT MAKE USE OF MORE ADVANCE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS BOOTSTRAP, JQUERY AND AJAX.
